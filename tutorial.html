This workshop is an introduction to version control systems with Git. 
 Version control systems are usually used by developers and people who write code, but are very useful also for people working with documents in general. 
 It is especially helpful for collaborative work with more than one person working on the same file. 
 This workshop is designed for people who have never used Git or a version control system before, and want to learn more about what version control systems can do for them and their work.

It will be a hands-on workshop where we will create a GitHub account, and code together to learn the basic flow of Git (from the command line?). 

Some Learning objectives:
- What is version control and why should I use it?
- How do I get set up to use Git?
- How do I record changes in Git?
- How can I identify old versions of files & review my changes?
- How can I recover old versions of files?
- How can I tell Git to ignore files I donâ€™t want to track?
- How do I share my changes with others on the web?

Reasons to use git & github
- level up your skills
- level up your resume
- level up your worldview
- Git is a tool for developers and testers to work collaboratively on code
- The primary benefit of git is the version control system
- But with some clever techniques you can weave git into a seamless machine for building, testing and deploying
- Take this workshop to learn the basics and then get boosted into the intermediates.

Git is the gateway to
- participating in open source projects
- streamlining devops
- making useful documentation
- having your own personal time machine

Two hour Git tutorial
- git is a time machine (theory of revision control)
- Create / clone a repo
- Commits / Updates / compare
- Markdown language?
- Revert
- Branch
- Merge 
- permissions
- following repos
- pull request
- The Github flow method
- github vs bitbucket vs others
Beyond git
- github pages
- Automation
- github project management
- github actions
- dependabot
Integrating with tools
- IDEs
- Atom
- GitKraken
- Github Desktop
- Slack

During the course of the tutorial each attendee will practice using git commands by creating and maintaining a custom webpage on their Github Pages site.

This tutorial is ideal for:
- people new to revision control
- People who have used other revision control than git
- Have used git, but are still uncertain about best practices
