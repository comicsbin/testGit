This workshop is an introduction to version control systems with Git. 
 Git is a tool for developers and testers to work collaboratively on coding projects.

The primary benefit of git is as a version control system, but with some clever techniques you can weave git into your continuous integration processes for building, testing and deploying.

Git is also the gateway to participating in Open Source projects.  Taking this workshop is a chance to level up your skills, your resume and most importantly, level up your worldview.

This workshop is designed for people who have never used Git or a version control system before, or have only a rudimentary understanding, and want to learn more about what version control systems can do for them and their work.

It will be a hands-on workshop where we will create a GitHub account, and code together to learn the basic flow of Git.
